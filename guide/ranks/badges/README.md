You can give players individual, server-wide badges.

Configuration file: `local/ftbutilities/server_badges.txt`

Example:
```
5afb9a5b207d480e887967bc848f9a8f: http://files.latmod.com/badges/latmod.png
slowpoke101: http://files.latmod.com/badges/ftb.png
```

First value is the target players UUID or username, second value is the URL (link) to an image.

You can also assign rank based badge with `ftbutilities.badge` permission (string).
